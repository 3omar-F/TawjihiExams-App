# TawjihiExamsApp

This app is made to allow the Tawjihi students (Grade 12 at school) to practice exams on all their subject materials.
It enables the student to browse all classes and view the subjects, as some of the courses are free and others are paid. After starting the exam, the student can mark questions as flagged to review them in the last of the exam, as he can open the list of the questions any time during the exam.

This app can serve two types of users:
- Student
- Adminstration


When tapping on the question number inside the exam screen, it takes you to review all questions, and you can end your attempt once you click submit answers.

-The student is not used to finishing the exam within the time shown; the time can be exceeded, and we will give him a note that time is exceeded in the results page.


-The Grade page has important notes about this grade and advice so the student will be aware of what to focus on since he entered the grade.

-Home page contains a section for advertising, so you can benefit from it.
